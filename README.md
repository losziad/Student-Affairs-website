# Student-Affairs-website
## I used in front-end: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
## I used in back-end: Django
### In this website the user can:
#### 1. add a new student to the system. Student information includes id, name, date of birth, GPA, gender, level, status=”active”, “inactive”, department, email, mobile number.
#### 2. update an existing student information ( except department field should be shown disabled for editing ).
#### 3. delete an existing student data through a delete button in edit student data page with a confirmation dialogue for the action before deletion occurs.
#### 4. search for “active” students by name in search for students screen and students with similar names having active status should be rendered as a table.
#### 5. select a specific student after searching to assign a department through the student’s department assignment page. The page should include student ID, name and a dropdown
####    list for available departments and a submit button.This action is applicable for students if level = 3 else an error should be shown to the user with a clear understandable error message.
#### 6. view all active/inactive students in a separate page rendered in a table with a related set of attributes only.
#### 7. change the status of student from active to inactive or vice versa from the table viewing all students.
